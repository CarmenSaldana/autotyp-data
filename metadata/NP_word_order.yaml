WordOrderNPBasic:
  Description : >
     Basic order of dependent and head NPs within NP. If different NP's have different orders, we code
     the position of dependent-marked full lexical NPs that are least constrained in terms of head or
     dependent semantics (e.g. in English this is the of-construction) and/or most common in usage. The
     coding is based on the information in the NP Structure module, with additional research when necessary.
